# Janitor
Janitor library. This branch is for the thread safe version of Janitor that does not use a global state.

[Original](https://github.com/RoStrap/Events/blob/master/Janitor.lua) was made by [Validark](https://github.com/Validark), however he doesn't really maintain that version anymore. It does have all the [original documentation](https://rostrap.github.io/Libraries/Events/Janitor/) for it though.

[Now on roblox-ts!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/janitor)

## Why use Janitor?

- Janitor makes dealing with garbage collection much less annoying and stressful because it manages them all in a nice interface.
- `Janitor:Add` returns whatever was added, which Maid doesn't.
- `Janitor:Add` also accepts a custom method, if you want to call `:Stop` on a `Tween`. You can see this being used in the [JanitorPromise](https://github.com/howmanysmall/Janitor/blob/main/src/Promise/init.lua#L100) library.
- `Janitor:Add` also accepts a custom reference to store under, which keeps the api more consistent. (`Maid.A = X` and `Maid:GiveTask(Y)` vs `Janitor:Add(X, nil, "A")` and `Janitor:Add(Y)`)
- Janitor also allows linking to an Instance, so when the Instance is destroyed, the Janitor cleans up everything along with it.

### Some less important benefits:

- Runs a little better than Maid does.

## Performance

Janitor runs incredibly well. It is quite a bit faster than [Maid](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/blob/version2/Modules/Shared/Events/Maid.lua) and around as fast as [Dumpster](https://gist.github.com/Fraktality/f0ab4ad950698e9f08bb01bea486845e). You can run the benchmark for yourself using [boatbomber's benchmark plugin](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/benchmarker-plugin-compare-function-speeds-with-graphs-percentiles-and-more/829912) and the bench found [here](https://github.com/boatbomber/BenchmarkerLibrary).
